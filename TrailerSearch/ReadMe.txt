Thanks for taking a look at this project. 
Please make a note of below points. 

The applicaiton fetches traliers from IMDB movie site. 
This is an educational project only. 
Not to be used for commercial purposes. 
I have made use of many educational sites retrieved via Google search. 

Running the application: 
Landing page link is http://localhost:8080/LoadTrailerAndDisplay/GetTrailers

Things not implemented as of now, but planning to add: 
1. IMDB does not seem to have a free consistant API. Hence the approach was to parse response of IMDB web search link.  
2. Cache enablement for better performance results. 
3. As of now results are purely based on IMDB search results only. Further enhancements could be to add Youtube etc and create an internal API to supply date.
