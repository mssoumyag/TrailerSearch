Thanks for taking a look at this project. 
Please make a note of below points. 

The applicaiton fetches traliers from IMDB movie site. 
This is an educational project only. 
Not to be used for commercial purposes. 
I have made use of many educational sites retrieved via Google search. 

Running the application: 
1. Port to be used is 8080. 
2. Landing page link is http://localhost:8080/LoadTrailerAndDisplay/GetTrailers
3. Running this application using a port other than 8080 would need an update in DisplayTrailers.aspx for correct redirection. 

Things not implemented
1. MVC redirection for default landing page and redirection
2. Cache enablement for better performance results. 
3. As of now results are purely based on IMDB search results only.
